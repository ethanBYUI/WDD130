        <h2>Childhood</h2>
        <p>Henry K. Junior was allegedly born in a small shed behind a dairy farm, claiming his first words were “no pasteurization.” He spent his childhood befriending cows, learning to churn butter, and plotting his future campaign against pasteurized milk. His parents still maintain they “have no idea where he came from.”</p>

        <h2>Manhood</h2>
        <p>Henry’s adult life took a dramatic turn when he traveled to Croatia on a “milk diplomacy mission.” Accounts differ, but it ended with a heated dispute, an overturned cheese cart, and Henry vowing eternal disdain for the Croats “because of the war.” To this day, he refuses to elaborate on which war he means.</p>

        <img src="images/image5.jpg" alt="Standing Against The Man photo">
        <h2>Standing Against the Man</h2>
        <p>Henry has been arrested twelve times for “raw milk activism,” including storming grocery stores yelling, “The cows demand justice!” His dedication to “the truth in milk” has earned him a cult following of dairy loyalists who travel state-to-state to attend his rallies.</p>

        <h2>The Future</h2>
        <p>Henry K. Junior insists his presidential victory is inevitable. His plans include replacing the national bird with a Holstein cow and appointing a Secretary of Milk. Despite his eccentricities, some supporters believe he’s the only man brave enough to face the milk lobby head-on—and possibly start a second war with Croatia.</p>
