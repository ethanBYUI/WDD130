      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        People will come to this site for all kinds of reasons. Some will click the link thinking it’s a serious campaign. Others will be sent by friends telling them it’s the strangest political site they’ve ever seen. A few might just be bored and hoping for something weird to laugh at. That’s exactly the point. The homepage sets the tone: confusing, ridiculous, and just plausible enough to make someone stick around a little too long before realizing it’s all a joke.
      </p>
      <p>
        The layout will be clean and mimic real campaign sites. Navigation will feel standard, and buttons will appear legitimate. There will even be fake testimonials from voters and images meant to sell the illusion. But a closer read reveals everything is nonsense—crafted to parody real political campaigns without ever saying so explicitly. It’s for people who enjoy satire without needing it explained to them.

      <h3>Political Views</h3>
      <p>
        Some visitors will be looking for real answers, like “What does this candidate believe?” or “Is this person actually running for office?” This is where the Political Views page comes in. It will be loaded with vague buzzwords like “freedom,” “justice,” and “family values.” It’ll sound just close enough to real campaign rhetoric to feel familiar, but nothing will truly make sense. It’s a collection of empty promises, circular logic, and feel-good slogans that don’t actually say anything.
      </p>
      <p>
        This page mimics real-world political ambiguity—sounding meaningful while remaining completely hollow. The reader might even start to doubt their own understanding, wondering if they missed something. And that’s the fun of it. The goal is to parody political language so effectively that the reader is in on the joke before they even realize what’s happening.

      <h3>Biography</h3>
      <p>
        This page will give life to the fake candidate. Their biography will be an outrageous backstory: born in a cornfield, raised by wolves, maybe even banned from five countries. Every detail will be absurd and obviously false, but just believable enough to make someone pause. Quotes from fake celebrities, unverifiable scandals, and tales of unbelievable adventures will paint a character too strange to exist—and yet oddly compelling.
      </p>
      <p>
        Readers should leave this page wondering how anyone could think this person is real—and then realize, somehow, they kind of do. It’s not just funny—it’s commentary on how larger-than-life real candidates have become. If this fictional candidate sounds familiar, that’s part of the satire. It’s supposed to.

      <h2>
        Wireframes
      </h2>
      <p>
        Create three wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them here.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Home</h3>
      <p>
        The homepage wireframe should include a hero banner with the candidate’s face, a navigation bar (Home, Views, Bio, Donate), a few fake testimonials, and a featured “endorsement” section from completely fake groups or characters.
      </p>
      <img src="FIX ME" alt="home page wireframe">
      
      <h3>Political Views</h3>
      <p>
        This wireframe will include a clean, list-style layout with each buzzword (Freedom, Prosperity, Liberty, etc.) as a heading, followed by nonsensical paragraphs that mimic real policy stances. There will also be buttons to “Learn More” that don’t actually lead anywhere useful.
      </p>
      <img src="FIX ME" alt="political views page wireframe">
      
      <h3>Biography</h3>
      <p>
        The biography wireframe should feature a profile image, several short “fun facts” in a grid, and a scrolling timeline of bizarre life events. Each event could include an image or quote bubble to increase the ridiculousness.
