        <p>Henry K. Junior believes freedom comes only when milk is raw and untamed.

He demands immediate legislation for “raw milk in every fridge.”</p>

        <p>Another key plank of Henry’s platform is his vow to stand against the Croats, whom he claims have a hidden agenda to infiltrate American politics through the yogurt industry. He’s promised sanctions, travel bans, and a congressional inquiry into what he mysteriously calls “the war.”</p>

        <p>Finally, the third vow Henry makes you is that all vaccuum cleaners shall no longer be used in government buildings or near sensative documents, ensuring national security from foreign spy ware.</p>
